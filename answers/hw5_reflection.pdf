I could have significantly reduced the amount of time in this homework by simply noticing the bug in the code that was mentioned in the discussion form.

The staff could have made it clear in class that there was a bug and where to fix it. The bug could easily been avoided if the staff did the homework themselves and did some simple testing. 

I wish I knew how to write a script to auto scrape names and courses off of a website, so that I could make a better and more accurate csv file. Furthermore, it would have been helpful to know how to write a shorter checkRep function so that it did not drastically slow down my code.
