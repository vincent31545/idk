I could have done better by submitting my code last night so I didnt have to wait 3 hours to get the fact that I had compiler errors back because I didnt comment out main.

The Staff could give us an extra late day because of the absurd wait times for submitty or provide multiple servers so its not just a single server that is completely overloaded.

I wish I had wrote specifications before I wrote the code, so that I could test those specific specification edge cases. It would save a lot of time.
