AcceptInput acts as the controller as it takes user input and runs blocks of code that lead
to what the user is looking for. printPaths acts as a view method and only prints back data in
a way that the user can understand. AcceptInput also has parts of a view method as it prints back
smaller blocks of code to ther user on more basic requests.
